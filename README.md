Affreschi restoration with inpainting

As a part of an intership at I3S lab, I approach the task of affreschi digital restoration.
the general procedure is as follows: 

1) select high resolution pictures of the damaged affreschi 
2) produce a proper mask for inpainting
3) test traditional algorithms 
4) test deep image prior technique
