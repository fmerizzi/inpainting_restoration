Affreschi restoration with inpainting

As a part of an intership at I3S lab, I approach the task of affreschi digital restoration.
the general goal of the project is as follows: 

1) obtain high resolution pictures of the damaged affreschi 
2) produce a proper mask for inpainting
3) test traditional inpaiting algorithms 
4) test deep image prior techniques, and compare it 
5) attempt text restoration/calssification for damaged unknown text

- [inpainting_basicsComparison.ipynb](https://github.com/fmerizzi/inpainting_restoration/blob/main/inpainting_basicsComparison.ipynb), testing "traditional" methods for image inpainting, using opencv library. Fast Marching Method and algorithm proposed by Sapiro in 2001.
- [inpainting_deepImagePrior.ipynb](https://github.com/fmerizzi/inpainting_restoration/blob/main/inpainting_deepImagePrior.ipynb), testing the deep image prior technique for image inpainting, with different architectures and parameter settings

## considerations on the making of the mask 
I considered several approaches on the creation of the mask selecting damaged areas, reported below:

1) __color based selection__, in this first attempt I selected a range of colors related to the damaged parts of the painting, however this selection proved to be too general, and its almost impossible to select only the damaged parts, producing masks that perform poorly.
2) __"magic wand" method__, in this supervised method we select both a color sample and a coordinate, and we expand the selection from the coordinate to the adjacent pixels that match our color sample to a certain degree. The quality of this selection is much greater than the simple color based selection, and the results are convincing. However, upon testing, the quality of the inpainting was poor. We consider this problem to arise because this method leave "exposed" the edges of the patch, the in-between areas where the color changes; this areas are then used by the network to recreate the patch. This results suggest that the best method to create masks is to __completely cover the damaged area__
3) __manual selection__, the final method used in our experiments is to simply create the masks manually, usually a paint tool, and making sure to completely cover the damage. The mask being slightly bigger than the damaged area proved not to be a problem for neural inpainting.

## Non-Local Patch-Based Image Inpainting 
- Minimize highly non-convex functional, it specifies that a good solution to the inpainting problem should be an image where each patch is very similiar to its nearest neighbour in the unoccluded area. Iterations are performed in a multi-scale framework which yields globally coherent results. 

we want to minimize the following highly non-convex functional:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Large E(u,\phi ) = \sum_{p\in N_p} d^2(W_p, W_{p+ \phi (p)})">

with H patch, and p pixel of H. and d is the distance to its nearest neighbour in the unoccluded region. 
The solution is obtained via iterated alternating minimization as well as multi scale framework, corresponding to:

1) nearest neighbour search 
2) image reconstruction

In calculating the distance they introduce a factor that represent pixel distribution, with the goal to distinguish between textured and non-textured data. Initialization schemes proved to be crucial, the author's applied a "onion peel" initialization made of layers 1 pixel wide, unitil the end of the occluded area. 

Default patch size id 7x7 pixels, with the outhor suggesting its optimal image size to be from 512x512 to 800x800. 

## Deep image prior 
In deep image prior we work with the following loss, where x is the output of the generative network and x0 the original image. m represents a mask which cover the parts of the image that have to be inpainted, and the respective pixels are excluded from the loss. 

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Large E(x,x_0) = \left \| (x - x_0) \odot m) \right \|">

Upon testing, we agree with the original author's claim that multiple skip connections are in general detriemental for the inpainting process.
In our tests we focused on deep generative "hourglass" networks, and we are limited on network size only by computation power and available memory. However, from another point of view, we could argue that sometime we would like to restore on a "lower level of abstraction", for example in the case where the finest details are just noise or damage on the painting. In this cases, the use of skip connections could actually produce better results, not tampered by the small details we know being imperfections.

Regarding network architecture, we notice that full layers bring better results than the more conventional hourglass architecture. However, this come at the expense of computational time. 

### comparing skip connections against no skip connections
For this test the network is an encoder-decoder structure made with 5 layers of downsample and 5 layers of upsample, all with a size of 256, with kernel size of 3x3 and stride of 1.

__full skip connections__

As we can see, ther skip connection reduce the detail in the inpainted areas, but in our situation some "smoothing" is not as bad thing. Hybrid approaches are also possible.
